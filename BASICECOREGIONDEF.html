<h3 style="text-align: center;">Pineywoods</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">The East Texas region is mostly composed of a thick forest of pine trees. This large forest is part of a much larger "region of trees" that extends into many neighboring states! 
    The terrain is hilly with low, wet bottomlands that grow a variety hardwood trees such as elm, mesquite and ash. 
    This region is home to a variety of plants and animals whose habitat preferences are woodlands and shorelines. 
    Among them are: cottonmouth snakes, squirrels, rabbits and opossums. Swamps are also particularly common, and they are (mostly) located in the southern most area of the region which is known as the ‚ÄúBig Thicket.‚Äù

    It features a mild climate with high humidity and ample rainfall, as well as distinctive wetlands that provide critical habitat for a variety of species and support the ecosystem's health. 
    The region's plant communities include coastal prairies, pine forests, and hardwood forests, while its animal species range from numerous bird species to fish and amphibians. 
    Threats to the ecosystem include habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the region and preserve its biodiversity.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Post Oak Savanna</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
    
The Post Oak Savanna ecoregion in Texas is a flat to gently rolling area that is dominated by the post oak tree. Its open grasslands, scattered trees, and fertile soil support a diverse array of plant and animal species.
