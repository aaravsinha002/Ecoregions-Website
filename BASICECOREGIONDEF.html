<h3 style="text-align: center;">Pineywoods</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">The East Texas region is mostly composed of a thick forest of pine trees. This large forest is part of a much larger "region of trees" that extends into many neighboring states! 
    The terrain is hilly with low, wet bottomlands that grow a variety hardwood trees such as elm, mesquite and ash. 
    This region is home to a variety of plants and animals whose habitat preferences are woodlands and shorelines. 
    Among them are: cottonmouth snakes, squirrels, rabbits and opossums. Swamps are also particularly common, and they are (mostly) located in the southern most area of the region which is known as the “Big Thicket.”

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Gulf Praries and Marshes</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">The Gulf Coastal Plains and Marshes Ecoregion is Texas's main coastal ecoregion! It is vaguely defined as being inside a coastal band from the state boundary of Lousiana to the city of Brownsville 61 miles wide. 
    The Gulf Coastal Plains ecoregion of Texas spans the coastal plain and lowlands of the Gulf of Mexico. 
    It features a mild climate with high humidity and ample rainfall, as well as distinctive wetlands that provide critical habitat for a variety of species and support the ecosystem's health. 
    The region's plant communities include coastal prairies, pine forests, and hardwood forests, while its animal species range from numerous bird species to fish and amphibians. 
    Threats to the ecosystem include habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the region and preserve its biodiversity.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Post Oak Savanna</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
    
The Post Oak Savanna ecoregion in Texas is a flat to gently rolling area that is dominated by the post oak tree. Its open grasslands, scattered trees, and fertile soil support a diverse array of plant and animal species. 
    The region is home to mammals like white-tailed deer, birds such as the northern bobwhite, and pollinators like bees and butterflies. 
    The Post Oak Savanna has a history of human habitation and use, with indigenous tribes and European settlers using the region for hunting, ranching, and agriculture. 
    Today, the region faces threats from habitat loss due to urbanization and agriculture, as well as invasive plant species.👍</p>
